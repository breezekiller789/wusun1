The parent, identified as Riverside resident Luvelle Kennon, died later at a hospital, said Riverside Police Officer Ryan Railsback.
The teacher, Linda Montgomery, sustained some scrapes and abrasions when she was grabbed and pulled into an empty classroom, Railsback said.
During the seven hour standoff, crisis negotiators made contact with the man, but never heard from Montgomery, which is why authorities decided to storm into the room. It is unclear whether the man was armed, but witnesses did not report seeing any weapons.
Officials canceled classes at the elementary school for the rest of the week.
The incident began shortly before two. when the man forced his way past staff in the main office at Castle View Elementary School, Riverside Unified spokesman Justin Grayson said.
